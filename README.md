# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!  
I’m **Rugved Pednekar**, currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science, and I’m passionate about crafting scalable, efficient, and innovative software solutions.

---

##  What I’m About  
I’m a developer and learner focused on the intersection of:
- **Deep Learning & AI** — building models and systems that learn and adapt  
- **Modern Web Development** — leveraging React, TypeScript and clean front-end architecture  
- **Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps** — using AWS, Kubernetes and scalable back-end patterns  

My aim is to fuse these areas into projects that are elegant, high-performance, and production-ready.

## 🛠 Technology Stack  
- **Front-end**: HTML5 + Tailwind CSS (via CDN) + vanilla JavaScript  
- **Build / Tooling**: Modern web best practices (you may expand this as you adopt React/TypeScript)  
- **Deployment / Infrastructure**: AWS, Kubernetes, cloud-native architecture  
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning frameworks, model deployment pipelines  

*(Note: This portfolio is currently built using pure HTML + Tailwind + JS; as I evolve my stack I will migrate to React/TypeScript in future iterations.)*
